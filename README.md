# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Background:

In this Module I am a data visualization specialist. I have just landed a new job for the Disaster Reporting Network, a company that provides data story telling on disasters around the world. My mission is to build insightful data visualization with interactive features on earthquakes from around the world. In my role I will support website and mobile application development by using the latest earthquake GeoJSON data from the US Geological website. I will traverse and retrieve data using javasript, D3 and Leaflet libraries and plot the data using mapbox through an API request. On the map the magnitude and the location of each earthquake will be shown in a popup marker. The diameters of each marker should reflect the magnitude of each earthquake and their size and color. Earthquakes with higher magnitude will appear larger and darker in color with a legend providing context for my mapped data. Finally, to illustrate the relationship between the location and frequency of sizemike activities and tecktonic plates you will add fault lines on the map.  

## Project Deliverables:

This assignment consists of three technical analysis deliverables as follows:

Deliverable 1: Add Tectonic Plate Data
